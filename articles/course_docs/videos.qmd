## Submitting assignments

For all problem sets or exams you complete in this course, you will be provided small to medium-sized datasets that you will need to conduct a set of analyses on using Google Sheets. The videos on this page will help you conduct these analyses as well as guide you through the process of submission from start to finish.

1. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RSw1uhTpQPCSF77SMWHRw55DCNkIvoAD/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Submitting a problem set</a>
  - This video describes how to submit an initial attempt for a problem set. Please watch it carefully before your first assignment so that you follow all the guidelines. 
  - Below is a checklist that you should go through BEFORE you submit any assignment/exam:
    - Copy over the solution template and edit it with your answers and explanations. Solution sheets should be brief and only mention numerical answers or provide brief explanations. They do not need to show any calculations - all calculations should be done in your worksheet.
    - Provide a link to the worksheet with ALL your calculations at the TOP of your solution sheet. Each question that includes any calculations should have a separate "sheet"/"tab" in your worksheet.
    - Make sure that the link you have provided opens up in an INCOGNITO tab without logging into any email.

  - This video describes how to revise an initial attempt for a problem set. 
  - Please make sure you indicate your revisions/corrections in PURPLE as shown in the video. 
  - Your new worksheet should only contain calculations that were incorrect or needed to be revised.
