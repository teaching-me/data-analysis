## Note to students

We will use the resources on this website along with Canvas throughout the semester. This website will always contain the most up-to-date syllabus, slides, and course policies. The syllabus, list of reading material, and other resources can all be accessed using the tabs at the top of the page or through the sidebar.

**You can start exploring the website now: Start with the [syllabus](articles/course_docs/syllabus.html)! **

Looking forward to meeting you in class!
